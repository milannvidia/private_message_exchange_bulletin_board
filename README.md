# Private and Unlinkable Message Exchange Using a Public Bulletin Board

This repository contains a Java implementation based on the paper "**Privately (and Unlinkably) Exchanging Messages Using a Public Bulletin Board**" by Jaap-Henk Hoepman from the Institute for Computing and Information Sciences (ICIS) at Radboud University. The project was developed as part of the **Distributed Systems** course. The goal is to enable private and unlinkable communication between parties using a publicly accessible bulletin board.

## To run the project

First run ServerMain.
Then run Client main.

this will start the server, and two instances of a client who can communicate.
